# LINQ in Manhattan Project

## Purpose:
This is a console run app to take in a JSON file and convert it to a readable format for C#.

## Summary
This is a console run app the executes when called.  What this app does is take in a JSON example file provided in the folder and displays the neighboorhoodd of Manhattan in the console.

### How to run the program:
This program requires visual studio 2017.  Have not tried using visual studio 2019 as it did not come out yet at the time when I wrote this.
<p>Clone the project to your environment</p>
<p>Run the program to start the console application.</p>
This will be under "Program.cs".

You may look at the source code for a better understanding.

* The console will welcome you to New York City.
* The console will output all the neighborhoods from the JSON file using Lambda Expressions.
* The console will filter out all the neighborhoods that DO NOT have names.  (using Lambda experssions)
* The console will remove all duplicate neighborhoods. (using Lambda expressions)
* The console will consolidate all the queries from above and display as a single query.
* The console will display the same single query but written using LINQ expression.
* When finished viewing, simply exit the console.

This assignment took about 6 hours to complete.  There are no xUnit Testing for this assignment.
